I created this dataset using web scraping for this I used python  Content The medal table for all Olympic Games from 1896 to 2018, including the Summer Olympic Games, Winter Olympic Games, and a combined total of both, is tabulated below. These Olympic medal counts do not include the 1906 Intercalated Games which are no longer recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as official Games.  Medal totals in this table are current as of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang County, South Korea, and all changes in medal standings due to doping cases and medal redistributions up to 25 November 2020 are taken into account
